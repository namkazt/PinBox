#### Notes
- Enable firewall to allow port 1234 in and out (or disable the firewall when using the software and enable the firewall when done)
- Make sure both devices are connected to Wifi
- You do not have to type in port 1234, this will crash the app
- If you are getting a black screen in Pinbox, open server.cfg in the Pinbox server directory and change monitor index to zero
